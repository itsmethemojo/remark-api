reMARK
======

simple bookmarking Tool consisting of a webpage (php,mysql) and a firefox extension

Bookmarking is easy. The maintenance of the own bookmark library is the pain in the ass. So why not just let the bookmarks sort themselves. This bookmark tool counts the times a site was bookmarked by you. So if you don't know if this site is already in your library, just bookmark it (again maybe). Same Situation with the clicks on the bookmarked sites. And over the time your important bookmarks will stand out clearly without you wasting your time creating any lists.

i used the php-login-advanced for authentification https://github.com/panique/php-login-advanced
therefore see the installation instructions

The firefox extension is a really ugly adaption of a tutorial I found. Maybe there is someone out there who understands and likes the fundamental priciples of a firefox extensions enough to help me out with that. ;)
